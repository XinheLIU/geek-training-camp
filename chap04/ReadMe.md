### Mathematial Thinking

What is **Mathematical Thinking**?

- Frame and Hypotheses
  - MLE
    - classificaiton, regression could be viewed as special case of MLEï¼Œ there are other cases as well
  - Machine Learning
    - Empirical: usually use result/some metrics to draw conclusion ("best model")
      - lead problems such as - ignorance of hypothesis (story)
      - sometimes the result reply on data, not reproducible
        - but in most cases, because the existance of big data, are useable in practice
- Elements and Relationships 
  - Logical
  - Empirical
- Patterns
- Intuition
- Retrospect and Empathetic 
- Bucket(In/Out/New)
- Strategic minds

Mathematical View of Machine Learning

- find $\hat{f}$ to approximate function f, is it possible
  - cannot find all X, y combinations (counterfactual): domain different
  - functional space different
  - hard to solve $\hat{f}$ - randomness
    - lack of information
    - noise, outliers
    - model error
    - optimization error
    - evaluation error
